    <h1>Tradition</h1>
    <p class="sub-section">
        We find our identity in Japanese folklore and the story of the Hannya—a beautiful women twisted into a <em>kijo</em> (demoness) from betrayal or Jealousy.
        It is from this story we derive and infuse the dangerous & artistic beauty found in our designs.
        Displaying the hannya mask, the mask of the kijo often used in traditional <em>Noh</em> plays, is rumored to have the ability to ward off evil but also ties into the buddhist concept of true wisdom.
