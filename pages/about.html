        <p>
            We find our identity in Japanese folklore and the story of the Hannya—a beautiful women twisted into a <i>kijo</i> (demoness) from betrayal or Jealousy.
            It is from this story we derive and infuse the dangerous & artistic beauty found in our designs.
            Displaying the hannya mask, the mask of the <i>kijo</i> often used in traditional <i>Noh</i> plays, is rumored to have the ability to ward off evil but also ties into the buddhist concept of true wisdom.

        <p>
            An aesthetic of betrayal, beauty, and jealousy.
