        <h1>2. Digital Customized</h1>
        <p>
            Our brand is the new underground. We’re not supreme-ly boring or a club for anti-socials.
            We are Hnya and we work with you to be one of us.
            Here’s the process:
        </p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick a base Hoodie color in <em>namanari white</em>, and <em>honnari lack</em></li>
            <li>HNYA Sleeves in <em>namanari white</em>, <em>honnari black</em> or <em>chunari red</em></li>
            <li>Send us your family crest and choose crest color (W/R/B) (Don't have one? Pick one.)</li>
            <li>
                Send us your 3 letters of your choice for the frontal diamond and pick a color (W/R/B).
                We will then input the jacket production number in the diamond; Only 1 of each number exists, ever.
            </li>
            <li>We will then send the digital design for confirmation.</li>
        </ol>
